# Bayesian Networks
This project implements several algorithms which designed to perform probabilistic inference in Bayesian networks.  
The algorithms used for the inference are Simple Inference and Variable Elimination (with two variations, elimination in alphabetical order and elimination in heuristic order).  
Look at [project instructions](https://github.com/bhori/Bayesian-Networks/blob/main/Project%20instructions.pdf) to understand the project guidelines.
